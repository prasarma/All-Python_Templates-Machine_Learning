H2O.ai(Auto-ML)
Currently i am using H2O libraries in my professional and personal projects. i am putting some projects (Kaggle and Analytics vidhya) here.


# All Machine Learning Templates (Seaborn,K fold, Grid Search, Random Search,AUC-ROC for all major algorithms)

I have created below templates so i can compete in different Data Science contests on Kaggle and Analytics Vidhya. By using below templates i will utilize my time into EDA only. below repositories contains all information required into machine learning.

This repositories contains all kind of templates which we can code in python machine learning. 

1. Seaborn and Matpoltlib  - template of all kinds of graphs,histograms which we used in machine learning
2. EDA Template - This file contains all operation which requires in exploratory data analysis
3. ML Classification - This file contains all classification algorithms templates like  (Logistic Regression,CatBoost) with                  normal ,kfold,Grid search and random search variations.
4. ML Regression  - This file contains all regression algorithms templates like  (Linear Regression,Random Forest) with                    normal ,kfold,Grid search and random search variations.
